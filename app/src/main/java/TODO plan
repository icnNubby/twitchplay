Bugs
    fix displaying appsecret at failed load in login activity
More features gradually from nearest to farthest:
    authorization flow, figure out what to do when streamToken expires
        implement it
    possibility to follow/unfollow channels
    saving information about users we follow (avatars, etc) to db
    notifications when in background
    sleep mode and setup to it
    backnav!
    preferences screen finally
    chat answers
    chat emodzi displays
    emodzi update and storage locally
    user view screen (prob with possibilities to edit urself)
    subscriptions workaround (? figure out how it works)
    syncing it periodically (prob on weekly basis? it doesnot change too often)
    animations (learning some ui stuff)
    launcher icon and overall beautify

Development stuff:
    add DI
    add atleast unittests
    add CI

Things to think at:
    better architecture? does app need it?


Kinda here you may stop.
