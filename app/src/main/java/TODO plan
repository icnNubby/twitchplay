// TODO !!!!LIST!!!!
implement stream fragment + chat fragment together in 1 activity (should work correctly in landscape
and portrait mode)
    add animation of appearing and disappearing of fragment
    3 modes (fullscreen and chat+video and chatonly)
    controls on player: fullscreen button, sleepmode button, goback button


change backgrounds colors overall
maybe implement chatfragment to overlap stream

think about better implementation of chat
how to close bufferedreader at disposal of activity, but not on next emittion
