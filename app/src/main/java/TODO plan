// TODO !!!!LIST!!!!
implement stream fragment + chat fragment together in 1 activity (should work correctly in landscape
and portrait mode)
    add animation of appearing and disappearing of fragment
    3 modes (fullscreen and chat+video and chatonly)
    controls on player: fullscreen button, sleepmode button, goback button

fix chat thread dying after some waiting time

change backgrounds colors overall
maybe implement chatfragment to overlap stream

backnav button
think about better implementation of chat
how to close bufferedreader at disposal of activity, but not on next emittion

chat improve (emodzi display, sending messages(after logging obv))
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

think about overall design
appbar on mainscreen overlaps nested recycler

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

add dagger and dependencies injection
decouple adapters and viewholders
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

make stubs when loading streams
load users thumbnails on streams page

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
update local caches w favourite streams

implement custom setting
    ex default quality, prob w list of nonstandard qualities if set for concrete streamer

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
far far away plans:
    favourite streamers local and remote
    sync them on authorize (?) and setting for that in settings

    settings
        pref quality
