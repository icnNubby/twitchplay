// TODO future plans
Bugs
    fix displaying appsecret at failed load in login activity
    fix repeating streams in "top" tab
    exclude unfollowed channel from online stream list, when returned
    fix schedulers everywhere, think how to separate responsibilities between views and repo
    stop caching instantly on stopping of activity, we waste traffic

More features gradually from nearest to farthest:

    add games to db and to
    notifications when in background
    sleep mode and setup to it
    backnav!
    preferences screen finally
    chat answers
    chat emodzi displays
    emodzi update and storage locally
    user view screen (prob with possibilities to edit urself)
    subscriptions workaround (? figure out how it works)
    syncing it periodically (prob on weekly basis? it doesnot change too often)
    animations (learning some ui stuff)
    launcher icon and overall beautify

Development stuff:
    add DI
    add atleast unittests
    add CI

Things to think at:
    better architecture? does app need it?
