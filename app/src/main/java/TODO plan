// TODO !!!!LIST!!!!
implement stream fragment + chat fragment together in 1 activity (should work correctly in landscape
and portrait mode)
    add animation of appearing and disappearing of fragment
    3 modes (fullscreen and chat+video and chatonly)
    controls on player: fullscreen button, sleepmode button, goback button

fix chat thread dying after some waiting time

change backgrounds colors overall
maybe implement chatfragment to overlap stream

backnav button
think about better implementation of chat
how to close bufferedreader at disposal of activity, but not on next emittion
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

implement autocloseable actionbar to get more space for preview.
think about overall design

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

add dagger and dependencies injection

implement authorization via twitch oAuth.
    update local caches w favourite streams

implement custom setting
